# MaxMargin

by Levi Mutter, Taylor Douglas, and Kyle Helstrom

Calculates the profit margin of a set of sales using both an AVL tree and a Map, intended to compare the two data structures.

Code is in C++ and the interface was created using glade and gtkmm 3.0.

A list of possible inputs for calculation in each category is given in inputs. The Sales Channel category can only either be Online, Offline, or All Sales Channels (default).
